# Engineering Team Generator

## Description

This is a NODE CLI application for building a software engineering team. The application utilizes NPM Inquirer to prompt users for various inputs to build a team consisting of a 'Manager', and any number/combinations of 'Engineers' and 'Interns'. Users can input the employee names, IDs, email addresses and role specific criteria such as office numbers (Manager), github account (Engineer), and school (Intern).

Once the user is finished with creating the team via the prompts, the application will create a team webpage that can be viewed in the browser, with each team member's information.

## Application Images

## Installation

This application requires the use of Node.js and Inquirer. To install this application, clone the project files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ntch2000/engineering-team-generator) and ensure you have Node.js installed. Terminal into the project directory and run the following command.

```node.js
npm install
```

This will install the required dependencies, including Inquirer and the application will be ready to run.

## Usage

To run the application, open a terminal and cd in the project directory. Once in the directory run the following command.

```node.js
node app.js
```

This will start the prompts to create an engineering team. Go through and answer each prompt and add as many team members as desired. Once the last team member prompt is answered, a 'team.html' file will be created in the 'output/' directory. This file can be opened in any browser to display the team webpage.

## Credits

Utilized NPM Inquirer which can be found at [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Inquirer allows for prompts to be displayed to the command line and responses to be output as an object in JavaScript.
